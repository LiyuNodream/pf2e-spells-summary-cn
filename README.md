# FoundryVTT PF2e Spells Summary

![](/readme/before-after.webp)

This module offers the ability to toggle between the regular and an alternate version of the character sheet's `Spellcasting` tab at any moment.

To toggle between both modes, you simply need to click on the spellcasting nav button <img src="./readme/icon.webp" style="width:24px;"/> at the top of the sheet.

The alternate version gather, sort and display all the available spells into a single table per level regardless of their category or casting type.

New informations are displayed to make up for the lack of category grouping: `DC`, `Check` and type `Innate`, `Prepared`, `Spontaneous` or `Focus`. The spellcasting entry name is also displayed when hovering over the `Check/DC` values.

When hovering over a spell, the resources used by the spell will also be dislayed and can be interacted with as shown in the image below.

The alternate mode does not allow to create, edit or delete the spells, nor does it allow to change the spells selected from a spellbook. It is there to make it easier to see what is available during playtime.
